1. Early boundary issue found == because of the boundary calculated on resolution size set in Game.java (baseWidth + baseHeight) it should be calculated on map size instead

















999. Extra -- . Screen size (for steam: 1920x1080) aspect ratio 16:9. Had to use general scaling factor for entire game (couldnt figure out any other way to do it in order for the game to be viewable and playable on 1920x1080)? Help if anyone else have any other idea? Is scaling the only way to do it for new screens with higher resolution today?
