1. Screen size (for steam: 1920x1080) aspect ratio 16:9. Had to use general scaling factor for entire game (couldnt figure out any other way to do it in order for the game to be viewable and playable on 1920x1080)? Help if anyone else have any other idea? Is scaling the only way to do it for new screens with higher resolution today? 

2. Scale factor right now decided: 2.
    - Based on that, 
    every sprite and tile shall be written in: 64px.
    Makes game look nice(r) and playable on a 1920x1080 screen.
