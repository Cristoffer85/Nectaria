1. Implement Map class, 
    1.1 - start implementing transition between multiple maps

2. Refactor gigantic CollisionChecker class into several smaller components based on 
        i. Straight,
        ii. Diagonal, 
        iii. Boundary, 
        iiii. Tiles,

To easier distinguish what component does what and not, uhuh-ehe.. :S *nervous laugh* also for reminder for one-self to remember all of this and be able to explain it eventual further someday

3. Fix offset between menubuttons responsive on window size

















999. Extra -- . Screen size (for steam: 1920x1080) aspect ratio 16:9. Had to use general scaling factor for entire game (couldnt figure out any other way to do it in order for the game to be viewable and playable on 1920x1080)? Help if anyone else have any other idea? Is scaling the only way to do it for new screens with higher resolution today?
