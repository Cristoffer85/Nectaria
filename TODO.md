1. Try to scrap original collision [vertical/horizontal] to [vector] collision instead. By learnings and realizations it will make the collision much much smoother and mor logic and easier for handling collisions.


    OTHERWISE:
    ----------
    Make Line2D collision smoother - Acc. stumbled on way to make collision better - working vertical and down right collision in new extra branch pushed - but not horizontal to left up, ?

2. Fix offset between menubuttons responsive on window size

















999. Extra -- . Screen size (for steam: 1920x1080) aspect ratio 16:9. Had to use general scaling factor for entire game (couldnt figure out any other way to do it in order for the game to be viewable and playable on 1920x1080)? Help if anyone else have any other idea? Is scaling the only way to do it for new screens with higher resolution today?
