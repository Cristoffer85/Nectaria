1. Diagonal 2Dline new collision - When players movement direction is down or right, the collision works smoothly. But when players movement direction is up or left the collisionbounce/offset is bouncing back a long way (left = 1tile, 64px) (up = 2tiles, almost 128px)

















999. Extra -- . Screen size (for steam: 1920x1080) aspect ratio 16:9. Had to use general scaling factor for entire game (couldnt figure out any other way to do it in order for the game to be viewable and playable on 1920x1080)? Help if anyone else have any other idea? Is scaling the only way to do it for new screens with higher resolution today?
